title: Localization of higher-level visual ROIs


description: |
  "This dataset is part of studyforrest dataset collection. For all participants
   in the phase2 extension of the studyforrest dataset, the following visual
   areas were localized:

   - fusiform face area (FFA)
   - occipital face area (OFA)
   - parahippocampal place area (PPA)
   - extrastriate body area (EBA)
   - lateral occipital complex (LOC)
   - early visual cortex (VIS)

   More information on the procedure and the results can be found in:

        Ayan Sengupta, Falko R. Kaule, J. Swaroop Guntupalli, Michael B. Hoffmann,
        Christian Häusler, Jörg Stadler, Michael Hanke. An extension of the
        studyforrest dataset for vision research.
